They mainly look attractive because of their neat white coat, which also makes it easier for the owners to locate their pets even in dark rooms. These ferrets are especially energetic in the morning and love to nap in the afternoons. They should be bathed once a month. Albino ferrets are often kept as a therapy pet for the kids and the elderly.</td>
