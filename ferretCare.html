            <h2>Life with Ferrets</h2>
            <p>Consider the following details as you determine whether or not to purchase a pet ferret:</p></br>
            <p><b>Their environment:</b> ferrets have a reputation for being escape artists, and Johnson recommends single- or multi-level, open wire cage designed for ferrets with a solid floor and a secure door for your ferret’s home. Due to lack of ventilation, glass enclosures (such a fish tanks) are not recommended. The cage should be located in a quiet area where the temperature can be kept between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and should include bedding (like a towel, blanket or old shirt) that should be washed a minimum of once per week. A litter box that fits in the cage should be filled with recycled newspaper products or aspen shavings. Avoid cedar and pine shavings, which can irritate the respiratory tract, and clay or clumping cat litter, which may be ingested by ferrets, Johnson said. Clean the litter box daily.
            </p></br>
            <p>Their diet: ferrets are carnivores and should eat premium commercial food that is high in fat and protein and specifically formulated for ferrets. They should not be fed dairy products, fruits, vegetables, or foods high in fiber, carbohydrates, or sugar, Johnson said. And, of course, ferrets should have fresh water every day.
            </p></br>
            <p>Their activity: because ferrets like to chew and swallow things, their toys must be sturdy and have no small parts that can be broken or pulled off. Toys made of foam rubber, latex, or plastic that might be chewed should be avoided, Johnson said. If possible, create “ferret-proofed” area for playtime by covering openings into walls, blocking spaces behind cabinets and removing any appliances or breakable items. Ferrets love interacting with their people, so be sure to spend time at least one hour with them every day and consider having more than one ferret to help keep them entertained.
            </p>
        </br>

             Their coats: ferrets are naturally clean animals and groom themselves often. They shed twice a year, however, and should be combed during these times to remove loose fur, in addition to regular nail trimmings and monthly teeth-brushing, according to the AFA. Regular baths with shampoo made for ferrets can help tame a ferret’s naturally musky odor but should not be given too frequently.
